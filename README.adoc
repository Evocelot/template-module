= template-module

Template module, aimed at generating content based
on templates, such as SMS messages, emails, or
file generation according to predefined templates.

The module is based on Jakarta and Wildfly technology,
which can be easily integrated with applications
capable of HTTP communication

== Technologies Used

* Jakarta EE 10
* Wildfly 30
* Maven 3.9.0+
* Coffee 2.6.0
* Mariadb

== Building the Application

To build the application, execute the following command from the root directory:

.build
[source,bash]
----
mvn clean install
----

This will initiate the build process of the application, verify the javadocs, and at the end, generate the necessary .jar files.

=== Disabling Javadoc Verification

To build the application without javadoc verification, execute the following command:

.build-without-javadoc-check
[source,bash]
----
mvn clean install -P-check-javadoc
----

To run the tests, execute the following command:

.build-with-run-the-integration-tests
[source,bash]
----
mvn clean install -Ptestsuite
----

== Startup

=== Database Setup

To set up the project's database schema, use the following repository: https://github.com/Evocelot/liquibase-base

As a first step, based on the provided repository, start the appropriate DBMS and update the database schema using Liquibase.

.run-liquibase-scripts
[source,bash]
----
docker compose -f etc/docker/compose/liquibase/docker.compose.local.template.liquibase.yml up -d
----

== Starting the Microservice

To start the microservice, first, we need to start an empty WildFly container.
To do this, execute the following command from the project's root directory:

.start-local-wildfly
[source,bash]
----
docker compose -f etc/docker/compose/wildfly/docker.compose.local.wildfly.yml up -d
----

After that, attach our built application using the following command:

.copy-war
[source,bash]
----
docker cp template-services/sample-jpa-service/target/sample-jpa-service-<VERSION>-SNAPSHOT.war evocelot-template-service:/home/icellmobilsoft/wildfly/standalone/deployments/ROOT.war
----

[NOTE]
Don't forget to update the <VERSION> part. You can find the current version in the pom.xml file.

== Creating Docker Image

To create the Docker images of the microservices within the xy-services module, execute the following command:

.create-local-docker-images
[source,bash]
----
mvn clean install -Pdocker
----

== Openapi

The list of endpoints supported by the application can be queried
through the /openapi endpoint, and can even be tested
through the Swagger UI.
